# About

This is a `python` based clifford circuit simulation package which not only offers the fast simulation but also supports analytical level manipulation of pauli operators and stabilizer states. And we are working on quantum circuit (strong/weak) simulations that include a few T-gates.

## Dependence of `PyClifford`:
- Numba
- Numpy

One can create a virtual environment containing necessary dependences with `conda env create -f env/miniClifford.yml`
